      <li>Planning an attack from the right, but is your left plank not vulnerable as a result? Is your flag properly protected?</li>
      <li>And above all, do you know what your opponent is upto?</li>

        <p>Your Marshal is your strongest man but vulnerable if not protected from the spy. Your Scouts are weak but mobile and effective in discovering your enemies manpower. You need the skills of Miners to disarm enemy Bombs, so don't lose them all early in the battle. Plant your Bombs skillfully. They will protect the most precious piece on the gameboard, your Flag.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Drag and drop your playing pieces from army base onto the battlefield.</li>
          <li>While hovering you can see your playing piece description on the right hand side of the screen.</li>
          <li>Remember! A piece with higher rank always kills a piece with a lower rank but not in case of spy attacking marshal. So, plan your strategy accordingly.</li>
          <li>And finally, don't forget to click on Ready!</li>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Both players have an army of 10 pieces, including a Flag.</li>
          <li>You must try to capture opponent's flag while protecting your own.</li>
          <li>The pieces have a specific sequence: the higher the number, the higher the rank</li>
          <li>If a piece with a higher rank takes a piece with a lower rank the higher rank wins and the piece with the lower rank is taken off the board.</li>
          <li>The flag can be conquered by any of the enemy's pieces that can be moved</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>You can move a piece one place to the left or right, or one place forwards or backwards.</li>

          <li>The playing pieces cannot move over or jump over the two lakes in the center of the battlefield.</li>
          <li>'Scout' is an exception to the above rules of movement. It can jump over an unlimited number of empty fields but not over lake or any of the other moving pieces. They can also not move diagonally. Scouts are the only pieces that can launch an attack from a sizeable distance.</li>

        <li>If the defending piece wins it stays where it is and the attacking piece is removed form the battlefield and placed on troops lost field.</li>
        <li>A piece with higher rank always wins whether while attacking or defending.</li>

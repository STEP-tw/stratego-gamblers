      <ul><li>
      On a lonely battlefield you meet your opponent for a battle that will decide the fate of your army.</li>
      <li>You are the comander-in-chief of a real army - your army to be precise. You deploy your troops. You alone devise how to wield your strike power, without neglecting your defences.</li>
      <li>Planning an attack from the right, but is your left plank not vulnerable as a result? Is your flag properly protected?</li>
      <li>And above all, do you know what your opponent is upto?</li>
      <li>You must plan the battle, advance your men, attack and capture the enemy flag.</li>

        <p>Your Marshal is your strongest man but vulnerable if not protected from the spy. Your Scouts are weak but mobile and effective in discovering your enemies manpower. You need the skills of Miners to disarm enemy Bombs, so don't lose them all early in the battle. Plant your Bombs skillfully. They will protect the most precious piece on the gameboard, your Flag.</p>
